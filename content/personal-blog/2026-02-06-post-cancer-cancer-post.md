**TL;DR:** 

On September 18th, 2025, I was diagnosed with colon cancer. I now know that after surgery on November 6th, all evidence of cancer was removed and I am now considered to have No Evidence of Disease ([NED](https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/remission--cancer-free--no-evidence-of-disease--what-is-the-difference-when-talking-about-cancer-treatment-effectiveness-and-results.h00-159460845.html)). Over the past 5 months, I have experienced the full rush of thinking: 

* that “I am going to die”
* and then: “Maybe I’m not going to die?” 
* and then: “I am completely cured*”
* and then: “Holy shit what just happened?”

But the story is a lot longer than that (also *appears to be* still ongoing). And if there’s any small chance that I can help one single person get checked and/or treated as early as possible, then, well… that’s what the rest of this is for. 

Also just a little warning: I’m really not shying away from the nasty shitty details in here (pun intended) in case it ends up helping someone share their symptoms with a doctor. So look away if you must!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

## 😴 First Symptoms

A little background: I live in Denver, CO with my (now) husband Liam & our french bulldog, Jack (the light of our lives). We’ve lived here for just over 4 years now, and were previously living in NYC before COVID drove me both insane & out to Colorado. We’re both decently active and eat decently healthy, although I’d say we’re now both *even more active* and *even more healthy*. 

In February of 2024, I had just finished a programming bootcamp in Denver as I was changing careers. About a month into my job search, I could tell that *something* was starting to feel different. I began to notice that concentrating on tasks was slightly more difficult  and I started to feel general fatigue during the day, usually after noon-ish. Sometimes the symptoms were very minor, basically unnoticeable, and sometimes I could barely get any kind of work done. It became especially frustrating when, after a few years of finally getting into a good exercise routine, I could feel myself starting to slip out of it - even just slightly.  

For me, it was really easy to chalk this up to general feelings of depression in the job search – I kept telling myself that things would get better once I had a job and didn't spend so much time indoors. After I let this bother me for long enough, I had a close friend recommend that I at least make a doctor's appointment to see if I could get prescribed something for depression that might, in turn, help with the general tiredness I was feeling. 

I agreed, and made an appointment with a new PCP. 

During my first appointment with this doctor in August of 2024, I mentioned the general tiredness and difficulty concentrating I'd been experiencing, and was prescribed an antidepressant. But before I left, I also inquired to this doctor about getting a general blood test done, something I'd been especially sensitive toward after a very close friend of mine lost her husband to [cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct cancer](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/bile-duct-cancer-cholangiocarcinoma). He had been diagnosed after a routine blood test with no real presenting symptoms. I shared this story with my doctor, and despite my tiredness symptoms, she assured me that a blood panel wouldn't be necessary, and that I was generally pretty healthy. While somewhat annoyed, I believed what she said and I left that appointment without any real follow ups. 

I now know that during this appointment in August of 2024, I already had a tumor growing in my colon, where it would continue growing for *at least* another year.

Just to take a pause here because this is one of those absolutely insane moments that I feel like needs reiterating: the main reason I asked for a blood test, at least at this first appointment, was because my friend's husband had learned of his cancer that way, and I just “wanted to check”, and while I was asking about this (and getting rejected), I *had a tumor*. 

Um. That is NUTS. Anyways. Moving on.

## 💉 Blood Tests + Second Symptoms

After *many* complaints to friends and family about not getting blood tests done, I messaged my doctor to really push for that blood test – here I got lucky apparently, because my doctor was OOO that day, and a fill-in doctor on the messaging portal immediately got me set up for a basic blood panel. I did the blood panel, and everything came back normal.

Around this time I also ended up getting a job at a company as a Developer Relations Engineer. While I enjoyed the work I was doing a *ton*, I didn't get the instant magical relief I was hoping that a job would bring me. I still suffered from fatigue (which seemed to be getting worse on a monthly basis), along with difficulty concentrating. In practice what this looked like was sitting down to get work done, only to feel stuck staring at my screen and unable to (sometimes) even start a task. It was like a cloudy haze that I could only attribute to getting older (?) or maybe a post-COVID brain fog (?) or maybe low testosterone (?). I really didn’t know. I’d also gone from pushing myself to work out on days that I didn’t want to, to more easily giving up and allowing myself to take more rest days that I had in the past. 

At this point, I tried everything: changing my diet, changing my sleep and exercise routines, having more coffee, having less coffee, etc etc etc. Nothing relieved my symptoms. 

Months after my first doctor appointment, in March of 2025, I started experiencing the first of many recurring flu-like, feverish symptoms. Every 2-4 weeks I'd slowly start feeling these flu symptoms come on, and typically they would only last for about 24 hours. The first time it happened I definitely expected I'd gotten COVID once again, but testing always came back negative. So I made another appointment with the same doctor from the year prior. 

Part of me felt like maybe I was crazy, and that these symptoms I was having were just in my head. BUT: each time I had feverish symptoms, I'd wake up the next morning with an alert from my Apple Watch reporting that my heart rate, respiratory rate, and/or wrist temperature were outside typical ranges. I guess in a way you can technically add me to the [many](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/1dursj9/apple_watch_saved_my_life_this_past_weekend/) [such](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/1jpkvpn/how_apple_watch_can_save_your_life/) [cases](https://parade.com/health/how-my-apple-watch-saved-my-life) of Apple Watch saving lives? Tim Apple, if you're reading this, I'd be happy to be featured (and paid) at the next keynote event!

At this appointment in May of 2025, I shared some of the new symptoms with my doctor. She asked if I had cough or cold symptoms along with my fevers, to which I replied no… I could tell that she didn’t like this answer, because if I *did* have those other symptoms, she could have more easily diagnosed me with the common cold. But she ended up diagnosing me with just that, anyways. Official diagnosis: hay fever / allergies. 

I remember leaving that appointment more frustrated than before. I was getting really sick of *knowing* that, every few weeks, these symptoms would reappear without fail; I basically found myself counting down the days until the next flare up would recur. Side note: I had a friend suggest that I do an entirely separate piece specifically on diagnosis frustration and why it can take so long to be diagnosed. Maybe I’ll do this at some point in the future, but just know this: compared to most people, I got diagnosed *FAST*. That’s not the norm, and even my timeline to diagnosis was incredibly frustrating. 

Fast forward a few months, and I finally made a virtual doctor's appointment with telehealth, who not only ordered me additional new blood tests, but also set me up with a new PCP who might take my symptoms more seriously. 

I'm still trying to track down the doctor that I spoke with via telehealth, because she was absolutely INCREDIBLE, and is likely one of the only reasons that I caught my cancer as early as I did. 

In June of 2025, Liam and I got married at a small little backyard wedding celebration with our most immediate family members. It was wonderful, beautiful, perfect, and amazing. My lovely sister acted as our officiant – we just didn’t know that we were going to put the whole “in sickness and in health” thing to the test REAL fast.

## 🎪 Intermission: Magic and Shit

Quickly: In late July or early August of 2025, a friend of mine (hi Grace) was learning to perform reiki, and despite me really not believing that would do anything at all (sorry Grace), she used me as a test subject during her training. It was very relaxing - but at the end of the session, she said this: “Don’t be surprised if you have a lot of bowel movements as your body gets rid of all the negative energy” (or whatever, something along these lines). 

Now cut to: three days of nonstop diarrhea. 

Okay, but actually, in hindsight this moment is still a huge sticker on the cancer calendar, because it served as a mental note of when things dramatically changed for me - and I do actually credit this experience for helping me get to diagnosis sooner. 

## 🍀 Lucky Me! (Part 1 out of 4,815,162,342)

The newest blood panel I did came back mostly normal (which itself is scary because I personally just believed for no particular reason that blood tests would figure out all my problems). The only thing that came back abnormal was my iron levels, and I was instructed to begin taking an iron supplement. 

However, at my appointment with my new (lifesaving) PCP in August of 2025, she immediately told me to stop taking the iron supplement. Fun little fact I learned: [it's more common for women to have anemia (iron deficiency) than men due to menstrual cycles](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21934611/). With men, it can be cause for concern, or... it can also be fine. In my case, it was not fine. 

At this appointment, I imagine reality being violently torn in half, and I am teetering on the edge between both of them: in one reality, my doctor dismisses the symptoms and the path I go down is much darker that the one I’ve been down. But for whatever reason, whether it be luck, or god, or privilege, or fate, or something else entirely, I get to take the path where my doctor asks: “any changes in bowel movements recently?”  

What had changed was this (look away now if you must!): 

* I found myself needing to use the bathroom MUCH more frequently – like, literally, 10-15+ times a day, usually more so in the morning. Does that sound crazy? Because yeah, agree.
* Despite each time feeling urgent, only small amounts would come out, and there was usually blood (bright red). 
* I felt a little physical discomfort in my abdomen, but not much - and I honestly attributed it to the coffee I was drinking (I absolutely never tried to stop drinking coffee). 

At this moment, after sharing what had changed with my PCP, my doctor immediately referred me to get a colonoscopy. 

#### 🚨 HOLD UP, PAUSE 🚨

If you think this sounds kind of normal, that a 31 year old can present these symptoms and be referred to a colonoscopy, think again! Despite colon cancer showing a DRAMATIC increase in younger age groups (and all cancers - highly recommend that you read **[this](https://www.businessinsider.com/true-cost-young-colon-cancer-crisis-2025-10)**) most doctors will not jump to this as a possibility . Although anecdotal (note to self to find this research), I've heard so many stories of young people over the past few months who didn't get diagnosed as NEARLY as early as they should have, either due to insurance denials or doctors just flat out ignoring or shrugging off patients' symptoms. 

I am incredibly lucky to have had this doctor refer me to a colonoscopy, because not everyone gets the chance, which, yeah – is incredibly infuriating. At another point in this story, another doctor who had been in the field for a LONG time said to me: “Really? You think you have colon cancer? At your age?” – and this was after the colonoscopy had found the tumor, so yes, I did think that!

## 🌌 Limbo

Me being the intelligent creature that I am, I just so happened to have accidentally scheduled my colonoscopy on my 6 year sobriety anniversary (I do not recommend that anyone ever do this). 

The procedure itself was easy, but I do remember coming out of my little twilight zone to this: the doctor and two of the nurses standing in the room with me, looking sad, with my husband sitting next to me, and the doctor telling me that they had found a “large mass”. I remember saying something like “Oh yeah that makes sense” or whatever. I then had to get a CT scan a few hours later, which sucked because it meant I had to not eat for a while longer, but once that was done I ate the biggest meal I’ve eaten in a long while. 

![](/images/uploads/img_5332_original.jpg)

*^ that tongue-looking thing is my tumor!* 

The rest of the weekend was like living in limbo – I was waiting for biopsy results to confirm what I basically already knew, although I wouldn’t get the stage of the cancer until after surgery later on. Right after the colonoscopy, I had three thoughts/visions:

1. My family and Liam at my funeral – this fun little vision is what made me cry for the one and only time while I actually had cancer (surprisingly I have cried much more post-cancer than during).
2. Being kind of glad that I would not be around to have to deal with my dog dying. 
3. If *someone* is going to do it, why *shouldn’t* it be me? (IYKYK!)

In all honesty though, aside from a few moments of envisioning my funeral, I actually greatly appreciated the limbo weekend. Nothing was officially official, there were no next steps I could take besides waiting and talking to friends & family, and really I just gave myself the space to breathe and relax while I still could. 

## 🔥 The Fiery Rings of Insurance Hell & 🫂The Comfort of Community

Pause: the next couple of weeks were mostly spent battling insurance on the phone. I don’t know that I can, with a clear head, take the time to reiterate how horrific the US healthcare system is. I don’t know that I can write about it without ending up on a list somewhere (I’m probably already on the list). In hindsight, again, I ended up extremely lucky, but the fury continues to burn. All I’ll really say here is that if you need some cathartic health insurance relief, I recommend you watch **[Saw 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saw_VI#Themes)**! Maybe I’ll be able to write about this more intelligently (and calmly?) in the future. Probably not. 

![](/images/uploads/img_1642.jpeg)

I will say, two things that fundamentally shaped my ability to get through this period without completely losing my mind: 

* Realizing how kick ass incredible my support system is. I leaned on so many friends during this time and I am beyond grateful (some who have had cancer themselves, some who know how to navigate the system from their own proximity to this disease, some who are just the kindest, best people who have helped me through every stage of this entire process).
* **[One Cancer Place](https://onecancerplace.org/)**: An organization started by a friend, Erika Brown (who has been an UNBELIEVABLE guide and teacher to me as I have navigated this entire process). Within a week of being diagnosed, I was on weekly Zoom calls with other colon cancer survivors, pre-vivors, and others going through treatment. I have learned so much from this group and found both community + purpose.

## 🩺  Consultation

Within a week of diagnosis, I flew to NYC to meet with a doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering (huge MASSIVE shoutout to Liam's sister, Ciara here -- you know why ❤️). It was during this consultation that the “I might die” turned into “Oh maybe not yet” – which felt worth celebrating. I learned that the path looked like this: 

1. Surgery to remove a section of my colon and tie it all back together.
2. During surgery, remove lymph nodes to check for any spread of cancer. 
3. If needed, doing a form of chemo where I wouldn’t lose my hair or have some of the autoimmune side effects that other chemotherapies can have. 

I didn’t expect things to be so straightforward - all of this was presented to me by my doctor in the most nonchalant, casual way. And honestly, this demeanor may have annoyed some, but to me it actually brought me comfort in the simplicity and regularity in which the plan was laid out to me. 

Again, cutting out the middle hellish parts of insurance phone calls that came after this, I was finally ready to schedule surgery in NYC.

One morning while I was back in Denver, I woke up just before 7am to my phone ringing. Picture this: me, having just woken up to answer the phone with a froggy sleep voice, being asked by a nurse at MSK if I’d agree to have my surgery LIVESTREAMED to a colorectal conference (actually, she used the word “TELEVISED” like this was a Netflix live event). Uhh definitely not - no part of my mind was mentally prepared to have a conversation like that, and I told her I was just not comfortable with that (but I also asked if I could maybe call her back later if I changed my mind?).

After taking a few hours to talk to people I trusted, I actually did end up calling that nurse back the same day, and I agreed to participate in the conference. 

So: if you were a doctor at the colorectal conference on November 6th, congratulations, it is so nice to finally meet you, you have seen the inside of my body!!!

## 🔪 Surgery

Anyway. Skipping ahead. 

The actual surgery day was kind of amazing because basically a nurse just called me back and I walked into the operating room with them and I don’t *think* they were blasting music in there but in my mind they *were* and the energy in the room was so upbeat and positive despite me being surrounded by a whole bunch of large devices that I had no idea the purpose of them at all. (Is this a run-on sentence?)

Some doctor started talking to me, who was very kind, and asked me where I was from, and I said Denver, and another doctor asked if she could put a mask on my face, and I said yes, and then the guy asked another question, but next thing I knew I was waking up in the recovery area. 

The next couple days in the hospital were surreal. The first day was incredible because I was on drugs and because FX was playing an Alien movie marathon which felt a little too on the nose for me because I *LOVE* the Alien movies. Also something something chestburster surgery something. They also made me walk a full lap around the hospital about 3 hours post surgery and I just…. It was all very surreal. I am also so grateful for my husband Liam, who held my hand the entire night the first night and let me squeeze it to death, repeatedly, while I had to deal with the gurgling sounds coming from the insides of my body.

![](/images/uploads/img_0021.jpeg)

Day 2 sucked ass. More pain, more discomfort, more laps around the hospital, more irritability – BUT: I am also very grateful for everyone who came to visit me on that second day, even though I was very unwell and remember warning my friends that I might explosively shit everywhere at any moment (I never did!). 

That second night though was absolute misery. But a fun memory: imagine me laying in the hospital bed at midnight, crying out of pain and discomfort while a nurse is asking if I want stronger drugs (I said YES!!! 💍💍💍)  and meanwhile on the TV is **[this scene from Harry Potter](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wDXurDHi2vo)**. Through my tears I INSTANTLY knew I would find this hilarious later, and I absolutely do. I am really glad that I said yes to the stronger medication though, because I finally got some sleep, and I woke up the next day feeling like I was past the worst of it.

By the third day I was cleared to go home on day 4, after having walked about 2-3 miles of loop-de-loops around the surgery recovery floor. I went from being unable to hold myself upright with a rolly cart for my IV bags, to walking a few miles each day, on my own in the town I grew up in, for the next 2ish weeks.

## 📊 Results

Two weeks after surgery, I got back my biopsy results. This is what is used to “stage” my cancer. Basically, they took a ton of lymph nodes out around the area of the removed colon, and tested those for cancer cells. I was *sure* (I was *POSITIVE*) in my mind that the results were going to show Stage 2 or 3, or honestly, much worse. I was entirely ready to prepare for the next part of this whole process, which would be chemo. 

I think I need to take one second to say that by the grace of some otherworldly power, I never really felt fear about ANY of this process as it was happening. I don’t know why – it’s more common for me to feel a lot of fear, about everything, all the time. But for some reason this entire process I didn’t feel scared at *all* (aside from the first few days). The only other time I felt deep, intense, soul-shaking fear was when I got the email that contained my biopsy results. 

I opened them – I saw some numbers and I *thought* I knew what that meant (thanks to everyone at **[One Cancer Place](https://onecancerplace.org/)** who had taught me how to read these complicated, medical-jargon results documents)… but there was no way… so I did what any online person would do in 2025 and I put my results into AI:

![](/images/uploads/cleanshot-2026-02-04-at-10.53.10-2x.png)

It was telling me that my cancer had not spread. With my heart absolutely beating out of my chest, I asked again… ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE!?!?!

![](/images/uploads/cleanshot-2026-02-04-at-10.53.17-2x.png)

I really could not believe it. And after meeting with the surgeon the next day, he confirmed the same thing: all of my cancer had been removed, no spread was detected, and no further treatment was necessary. Later on, I would do **[MRD testing ](https://www.natera.com/resource-library/signatera/what-is-mrd-testing-and-how-can-it-help-monitor-cancer-recurrence/)**(which is REAL science that sounds like ACTUAL MAGIC - and maybe those two things are the same) that would absolutely confirm that I was entirely cancer free. Since that time I’ve met with an absolutely incredible oncologist at UCHealth in Aurora, CO, and for the first time it’s really beginning to sink in that I am *actually* cancer free. 

## 🧠 My Mind rn

I am posting this on my 3 month post-surgery anniversary (oooh which I just remembered means I’m now allowed to do ab exercises again!!). 

But I’ve been writing this for a LONG time, and if you have read this far, I appreciate you, and hope that there’s SOMETHING you can take away from this. I do really hope that something in this helps someone, at some point, down the line. Whether it be relating to symptoms or helping someone learn to advocate for themselves, etc, etc, etc. 

Lately, I have been having cancer whiplash – that’s at least the best way I can describe it at least. Everyone always says that a diagnosis like this completely changes your life, and that’s true. But it feels even more true recently. There are so many things in my life I haven’t done, or feel like I haven’t done to the best of my ability, and I can literally *feel* the fabric of myself changing over these past few weeks / months. I still get stressed, and worry, but I also feel so unbelievably grateful, and excited about my future, and want to just connect with people and help people at every single moment that I can get. 

Right now, I am having a mini identity crisis and I am loving every second of it: because I get to feel new things, and want new things, and try new things – and it’s all extremely fun. And I really may never get over this feeling of being so incredibly lucky, and grateful, and in absolute disbelief.
